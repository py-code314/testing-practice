# Solution for Project: Testing Practice (The Odin Project)

## Overview
This is a practice exercise for writing unit tests using Jest. The project is based on the [The Odin Project - Testing Practice](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-testing-practice) lesson.

### Functions
- A function `analyzeArray` that takes an array of numbers as input and returns an object with the following properties:
  - `average`: the average of the numbers in the array
  - `min`: the smallest number in the array
  - `max`: the largest number in the array
  - `length`: the number of elements in the array
- A function `caesarCipher` that takes a string and a number as input and returns a new string that has been encrypted using the Caesar cipher.
- A function `calculator` that returns an object with the following functions:
  - `add`: adds two numbers
  - `subtract`: subtracts two numbers
  - `divide`: divides two numbers
  - `multiply`: multiplies two numbers
- A function `capitalize` that takes a string as input and returns a new string with the first letter capitalized. 
- A function `reverseString` that takes a string as input and returns a new string with the characters in reverse order.

### Testing
Test files for each function are included in the `__tests__` directory. Each test file contains various test cases for the function being tested. Tests check for expected behavior, error handling, and edge cases. The tests are written using Jest.
